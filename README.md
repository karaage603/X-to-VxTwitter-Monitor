# X-to-VxTwitter-Monitor

Because of a certain man's shenanigans on Twitter, tweets with images posted onto apps like Discord which would originally show a preview of the images have failed to do so.
Thankfully, with services like vxtwitter (https://github.com/dylanpdx/BetterTwitFix), you can easily fix the link to show the preview, but to do it manually for every tweet you want to share is a chore.

This simple batch script runs continuously in the background to monitor for x.com links to be converted to vxtwitter.com links every 5 seconds.

Just run it once for every Windows start up and you're good to go.
